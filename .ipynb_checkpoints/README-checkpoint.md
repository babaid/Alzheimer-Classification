# Alzheimer-Classification
Using pytorch to classify different stages of Alzheimer

The Dataset has it's source on Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images).
I've tried different convolutional network architectures, experimenting with adaptive layers, skip connections, and reasonable data augmentations.
I've decided to use RMSprop as optimizer instead of other alternatives, it proved itself to be the fastest in terms of convergence for this task.
